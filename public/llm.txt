## Common Questions & Answers
Q: How do I know if I have rising damp?
A: Look for tide marks up to 1m above floor level, salt deposits (white crystals/efflorescence), peeling wallpaper at skirting level, musty smell. Rising damp affects ground floor only and is typically worse in winter when evaporation is slower.

Q: Is it rising damp or condensation?
A: Condensation appears as water droplets on cold surfaces (windows, walls), typically worse in winter mornings, affects any floor level, improves with ventilation. Rising damp shows tide marks, affects ground floor only, has salt deposits, and doesn't improve with ventilation.

Q: How much does damp proofing cost in Essex?
A: Damp survey £150-£300, rising damp treatment £1,500-£4,500 for typical terraced/semi house (includes DPC injection and replastering), penetrating damp £300-£2,500. Costs vary by property size, wall thickness, and severity.

Q: Do you cover [specific Essex location]?
A: Yes, we cover 15-mile radius from Seven Kings including all major Essex and East London areas: Ilford, Barking, Dagenham, Romford, Hornchurch, Upminster, Chadwell Heath, Goodmayes, Manor Park, East Ham.

Q: What's included in a damp survey?
A: Visual inspection, calibrated moisture meter readings, salt analysis where required, identification of damp type, root cause diagnosis, external inspection, treatment recommendations, written report with photos, fixed-price quote.

Q: What is a damp proof course (DPC)?
A: A DPC is a horizontal barrier in walls that prevents moisture rising from the ground. Modern DPCs are plastic membranes; older properties have slate, bitumen, or nothing. Chemical DPC injection creates a new barrier using silicone-based cream injected into drilled holes.

Q: How long does rising damp treatment last?
A: A properly installed chemical DPC using BBA-approved products lasts 20+ years, which is why we provide 20-year insurance-backed guarantees.

Q: Do I need to replaster after DPC treatment?
A: Usually yes. Rising damp deposits hygroscopic salts in plaster that continue attracting moisture even after DPC installation. Specialist renovating plaster is required for a lasting solution.

## Local Expertise
Essex has significant Victorian and Edwardian housing stock, particularly in Ilford, Seven Kings, and Barking areas. Many properties have original slate DPCs that have failed after 100+ years. The Becontree Estate in Dagenham (1920s-30s) has properties with bitumen DPCs now reaching end of life. Clay soil and variable water tables across Essex affect rising damp prevalence.
